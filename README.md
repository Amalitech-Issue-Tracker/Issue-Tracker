## Status

First release.

## Inspiration

This was a capstone project that climaxed the graduate trainee program by Amalitech Ghana. It was a challenge that we faced with excitement, as this was a huge opportunity to put what we had learned during the program into practice. The thrill of building a whole system from scratch also served as a great form of motivation.
